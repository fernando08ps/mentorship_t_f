# Data Science Mentorship Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to my Data Science Mentorship Project repository! This project is dedicated to exploring and solving various business challenges using data science methodologies. Throughout this project, I will be writing Python code and utilizing Jupyter notebooks to analyze data, derive insights, and propose solutions to real-world business problems.

## What's Inside

- **Python Scripts**: Collection of Python scripts demonstrating data processing, analysis, and modeling techniques.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks containing detailed data analysis, visualizations, and step-by-step walkthroughs of data science workflows.
- **Datasets**: A curated selection of datasets used for analysis, sourced from various domains to address diverse business challenges.

## Business Challenges

The focus of this project is to tackle business-related problems, such as:
- Customer churn prediction
- Sales forecasting
- Market segmentation
- Fraud detection
- And more...

Each challenge is approached with a data-driven mindset, seeking to provide actionable insights and recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For scripting and data analysis.
- **Jupyter**: For interactive data exploration and visualization.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Key Python libraries for data manipulation and plotting.
- **Scikit-learn, TensorFlow**: For machine learning and predictive modeling.
